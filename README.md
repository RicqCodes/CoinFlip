# Ethereum Heads or Tails dApp
Bet on either heads or tails and win (or lose) ether.
* Provably fair. Nobody can tinker with the random number generation.
* Frontend and smart contract program code is open-source (https://github.com/rene78/Heads-Or-Tails).
* I don't keep any fees. There are only the miner fees.
* Currently on Ropsten test net. Gonna transfer it to main net soon.
